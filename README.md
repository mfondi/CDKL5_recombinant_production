# CDKL5_recombinant_production
Constraint-based metabolic simulations for the heterologous production of hCDKL5 protein in bacteria

This code refers to the simulation for the heterologous production of the human protein hCDKL5 in the host bacterium Pseudolateromonas haloplanktis TAC125 using contraint-based metabolic modelling.
The main script (CDKL5_pB40intoModel_MF_v2.m) reproduces all the analyses and the figures reported in the manuscript "Modelling hCDKL5 heterologous expression in bacteria" by
